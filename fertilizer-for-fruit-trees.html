                  is critical. Fruit trees don’t just need general nutrients;
                  they require a balanced and precise mix that supports healthy
                  roots, abundant flowering, and high-quality fruit production.
                  That’s where
                  CompleteGrow, a premium Australian fertiliser brand, steps in with their
                  latest formulation: Advanced NPK 4-18-38 + Calcium &
                  Magnesium.

                  This targeted fertiliser is designed specifically to enhance
                  fruit tree performance, with a focus on improved flowering,
                  root development, and sweeter fruit—all tailored to thrive
                  under Australia’s unique growing conditions.

              Why the Right Fertilizer for Fruit Trees Is Essential
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base">
              Fruit trees follow a seasonal growth cycle: initial root and shoot
              development, flowering and pollination, fruit set, and finally
              fruit growth and ripening. Each stage requires a specific nutrient
              profile:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base">
              <li>Nitrogen (N) supports leaf and shoot growth.</li>
              <li>
                Phosphorus (P) is vital for strong root development and
                flowering.
              </li>
              <li>
                Potassium (K) helps with fruit formation, size, sweetness, and
                disease resistance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Calcium and Magnesium, though secondary nutrients, play crucial
                roles in cell wall integrity and chlorophyll production.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              A common mistake is using high-nitrogen fertilisers meant for
              leafy vegetables or lawns. While these might green up the canopy,
              they often suppress flowering and reduce fruit yields. For that
              reason, a specialised fertilizer for fruit trees—like the one from
              CompleteGrow—is key to achieving strong yields and high-quality
              fruit.

              The Science Behind CompleteGrow’s Advanced NPK 4-18-38 + Ca & Mg
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base">
              CompleteGrow’s Advanced NPK formula is not a generic blend—it’s
              formulated for the specific demands of fruit trees at the
              flowering and fruiting stages. Here’s a breakdown of why it works:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base">
              <li>
                <strong>NPK ratio of 4-18-38</strong>: This low-nitrogen,
                high-phosphorus, and very high-potassium formulation is ideal
                for fruit trees. The nitrogen (4%) supports maintenance growth
                without causing overly leafy canopies. The phosphorus (18%)
                boosts flower and root development, while potassium (38%)
                ensures strong fruit set, sweetness, and resilience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Calcium (Ca)</strong>: Calcium is essential for
                strengthening cell walls in fruit, reducing issues like
                cracking, blossom end rot, and premature drop. It also enhances
                the firmness and storability of fruit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Magnesium (Mg)</strong>: Magnesium helps with
                photosynthesis, ensuring the tree can convert sunlight into
                energy for fruit development. It also improves nutrient
                transport throughout the plant.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tailored for Australian conditions</strong>: Designed
                and manufactured in Australia, this fertiliser considers local
                challenges such as sandy soils, water restrictions, and harsh
                sun exposure—conditions that often require extra potassium and
                calcium for plant resilience.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              This unique formulation supports not just growth, but high
              fruiting efficiency and quality, which is why it’s quickly gaining
              attention among serious backyard growers and orchardists alike.

              Benefits You Can Expect for Your Fruit Trees
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base">
              <strong>Enhanced Root Health</strong>: The phosphorus content
              supports strong, deep roots—especially valuable for young trees or
              those recovering from transplant shock or drought. Strong roots
              mean more efficient nutrient uptake and better drought resistance.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              <strong>Improved Flowering and Fruit Set</strong>: During the
              critical blooming phase, phosphorus and potassium help drive
              flower production and transition into fruit. You’ll likely see
              better flowering intensity and a more reliable fruit set.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              <strong>Bigger, Sweeter Fruit</strong>: Potassium is a key player
              in increasing fruit size, colour, sugar levels, and flavour. If
              your citrus or stone fruit often tastes bland or lacks sweetness,
              boosting potassium can make a noticeable difference.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              <strong>Stronger, Healthier Fruit</strong>: Calcium fortifies cell
              walls, improving fruit firmness and shelf-life. This is
              particularly beneficial for commercial growers or anyone storing
              produce post-harvest.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              <strong>Greater Resilience</strong>: The formula strengthens trees
              during periods of stress—whether from drought, heatwaves, or heavy
              fruit loads. Healthier trees are better able to defend against
              pests, diseases, and environmental fluctuations.

              How to Apply This Fertilizer for Best Results
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base">
              <strong>When to Apply</strong>: Use during early spring to support
              flowering and again during fruit development. Avoid applying high
              potassium late in the season if you want to limit late growth
              spurts that can reduce winter hardiness.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              <strong>Application Method</strong>: This product is available in
              liquid form and works for both soil and foliar applications.
              Always mix according to label instructions to avoid overfeeding.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              <strong>Irrigation Support</strong>: Ensure soil is moist before
              and after application. Fertiliser uptake is greatly improved when
              water is available, especially in warm conditions.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              <strong>Frequency</strong>: Regular feeding (every 2–4 weeks
              during active growth) may yield better results than a single large
              application.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm sm:text-base mt-4">
              <strong>Supplementation</strong>: While this formula covers macro
              and key secondary nutrients, monitor for any micronutrient
              deficiencies, especially in older trees or those in sandy soil. A
              complete fertiliser program may include additional trace minerals
              as needed.
